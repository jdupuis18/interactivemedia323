	<p> Fire and Ice by Robert Frost</p>
	<br>
	<p>The world will end</p>
	<br>
	<p>Some say in fire,</p>
	<br>
	<p>Some say in ice.</p>
	<br>
	<p>From what I've tased of desire</p>
	<p>I hold with those who favor fire.</p>
	<br>
	<p>BUT</p>
	<br>
	<p>if it had to perish twice,</p>
	<p>I think I know enough of hate</p>
	<br>
	<p>To say that for destruction ice</p>
	<p>is aloso great and would suffice</p>
