	<p>Fire and Ice</p>
    <p>by Robert Frost</p>
	<br>
	<p>Some say the world will end in fire,</p>
	<br>
    <p>Some say in ice.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</p>
    <br>
    <p>I hold with those who favor fire.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But if it had to perish</p>
    <br>
    <p>twice,</p>
    <br>
    <p>I think I know enough of hate</p>
    <br>
    <p>To say that for destruction ice
Is also great</p>
    <br>
    <p>And would suffice.</p>
