<title>Fire and Ice</title>

	<p>Some say the world will end in <h1>fire</h1>,</p>
	<br>
    <p>Some say in <h2>ice</h2>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</p>
   I hold with those who favor <h1>fire</h1>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But if it had to perish twice,
    I think I know enough of hate</p>
    <br>
    <p>To say that for destruction <h2>ice</h2></p>
    <br>
    <p>Is also great</p>
    <br>
    <p>And would suffice.</p>
