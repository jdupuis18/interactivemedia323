<div id="intro">Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.</div>
<div id="fire">From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.</div>
<div>But if it had to perish twice,</div>
<div id="ice">I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice<div>
<div id="end">Is also great
And would suffice.</div>
