<div class="Fire">Some say the world will end in fire,</div>
<div class="Ice">Some say in ice.</div>
<div class="Fire">From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.</div>
<div class="Ice">But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.</div>
