	<p>Some say the world will end in <strong>fire</strong>,</p>
	<p>Some say in <em>ice</em>.</p>
	<p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of <strong>desire</strong></p>
	<p>I hold with those who favor <strong>fire</strong>.</p>
	<p>But if it had to perish <em>twice</em>,</p>
	<p>I think I know enough of <h5>hate</h5></p>
	<p>To say that for destruction <em>ice</em></p>
	<p>Is also <h5>great</h5></p>
	<p>And would <em>suffice</em>.</p>
