  	<li>Some say the world will end in fire,</li>
	<br>
	<li>Some say in ice.</li>
	<br>
	<li>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</li>
	<br>
	<li>I hold with those who favor fire.</li>
	<br>
	<li>But if it had to perish twice,</li>
	<br>
	<li>I think I know enough of hate</li>
	<br>
	<li>To say that for destruction ice</li>
	<br>
	<li>Is also great</li>
	<br>
	<li>And would suffice.</li>
